# text_generation_rnn
Generative DL model for text generation

The project tries to emulate the research presented in the paper "BERT has a mouth and it must speak: BERT has a Markov Random Field Language Model" by generating a LSTM model which takes in input different text files.

The model reads left to right and tries to predict the next word based on probabilities of words.
